Assignment: Time Complexity and Space Complexity Analysis

DoraemonPocket; Space Complexity: O(n)
    The pocket needs space proportional to the number of items it contains.

addItem; Time Complexity: O(1)
    Adding items is usually fast, taking a short amount of time.

removeItem; Time Complexity: O(n)
    Removing items might take longer, especially if many items are in the pocket.

printItmes; Time Complexity: O(n)
    Printing all items also takes time, and it depends on the number of items.

getNumItems; Time Complexity: O(1)
    Checking the number of items is quick and doesn't take much time.
