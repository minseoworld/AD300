 Time Complexity
 - With no memorization(initial)
 Time: A lot, grows quickly with n.
 Reason: Repeats calculations, slow for big n.

 - With memorization
 Time: Faster, grows linearly with n.
 Reason: Remembers past results, avoids doing the same thing many times.

 Time Complexity with Memoization
 Recomputations: Remembering old answers stops doing the same work again.
 Map Operations: Using the memory map is quick but adds a bit of work.

 Space Complexity
 - With no memoization(initial)
 Space: Grows with n.
 Reason: Keeps track of where it is in a big list.

 - With memorization
 Space: Grows with n.
 Reason: Keeps old answers, uses extra memory for efficiency.

 Comparison of Space Complexity
 Same space for both, but memoization makes it much faster, especially for big n.
